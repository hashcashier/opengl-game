WINDOWS/UBUNTU COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:

the .gitignore file includes "platformIndependentHeader.h", which is why you will not see this file on the repo.
In order to be able to compile, you must copy from the headers folder one of the two files "windows.h" or "linux.h", depending on your platform.
The header file you will use to compile must be copied to the src folder and renamed as platformIndependentHeader.h
Do not remove this file from the git-ignore and do not modify it unless you can't compile.
